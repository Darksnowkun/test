zero the mean for covariance matrix

Gender highly coorelated -> check for coorelation. then prune features to make them better

PCA feature 1 is a combination of original dimension 1 and original dimension 2

PCA unsupervised so be careful just because it matches the PCA line doesn't mean you can tell the fitted data apart still

For HW4 mean changes but covariance stays the same

For Diagonal Loading:
just check the training data to see
